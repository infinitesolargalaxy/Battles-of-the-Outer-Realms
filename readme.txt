Known Issues:
-For the raiding mission, the player can just jettison the cargo, complete the missions, pick up cargo, jettison, and so
on.
-For the fortify mission, it is possible that the Aurochs doesn't build any turrets. It is more likely for the second
ring to not be built than the first.
-Missions that should start even if player declines doesn't start
