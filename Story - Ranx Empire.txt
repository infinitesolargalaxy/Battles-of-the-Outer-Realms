The Ranx Warlords has begun to weaken as territorial expansion has slowed to but a trickle. Without the expertise to 
create new weapons, the Old designs are starting to be outmatched by new Commonwealth Fleet weapons. In this time an 
unlikely alliance is in the making with the Black Market Syndicat, the trade of surplus high quality ores for 
new weapons. 

The syndicat jumped at the offer since the value of the ore far surpasses the value of the weapons that are being traded
for. They began building up funds and hiring mercenaries while their stocks of military weapons depleted. When nearly
depleted, the syndicat carries out alpha strikes on Corporate Hierarchy stations, raiding weapons. Emboldened by 
initial success, they move onto more prominent corporations such as Raisiermessier, Makayev, and Bushido.

The Corporate Hierarchy Operations Command deploys loads of privateers and agents to attack Syndicat stations. And to 
intercept Syndicat convoys which brings them into conflict with the Ranx.

With new weapons, the Ranx war machine begins again, annexing Commonwealth space. The Fleet responds half-heartedly as most of their forces are tied up with the Ares Orthodoxy. This creates even more anti-ares war sentiment especially in 
the UG. In the OR, fleet forces easily fend of Ranx attacks.
