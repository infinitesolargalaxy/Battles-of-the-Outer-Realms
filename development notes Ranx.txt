Should be a level 7-8 story branching off from one of the level 6 systems.
Story is similar to earlier treatment in 'Story - Ranx Empire.txt', just note that we are scaling it down. It will just be one warlord (think of warlord's in
Star Wars EU after fall of empire). Rather than it being the Ranx Empire, its an ambitious warlord, this makes more sense since the Ranx Empire is still powerful
according to the unreleased ORE. A warlord though will have considerably less R&D (if any) and be facing attrition over time. Thus making the need of weapons
make sense. In addition, we have a rising star as the syndicat lord whos trying to find another way to gain wealth. 
<Ranx Warlord> is buying the weapons at 1.25 times market value. He doesn't have any CW credits so is trading in ore. 

Characters:

<Ranx Warlord>: An ambitious and ruthless man. His strength has brought many to his side. Currently resides in the prosperous ore-filled <Star system> 
			Has many rivals.
<Warlord Captain>: The right hand man of <Ranx Warlord>. Also commands a ranx dreadnought
<Recruitable wingment>


<Syndicat Lord>: A young and rising crimelord who has had the great fortune to be seen as a partner for <Ranx Warlord>. He knows that buttkissing is needed to
rise in the ranks. (Submissive in presence of <Ranx Warlord> but bold elsewhere. Presents a facade of weakness). He should fly a Mikeno destroyer.
